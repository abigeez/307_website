            My husband and I, Jeff have called New York City home for the past 15 years. We moved from a small town in upstate New York, where we stil own our dairy farm. One day, we decided to keep our farm and sell the delicious, fresh and certified-organic milk to our friends here in NYC for them to try. Our milk was such a rave that we decided that it would be a great idea to bring that "small-town" feel to NYC with our hand-delivered fresh and certified organic milk bottles.
